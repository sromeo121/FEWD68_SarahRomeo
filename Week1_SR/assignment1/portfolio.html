  <!-- I wanted to have three images in a row with text under each; this is the way I figured out how to do it, but I do feel like there must be a better way -->

    <p>1. I've already put a few personal sites into development, but I've never actually launched one. In this class, I would love to design a personal site where I can display my portfolio and resume, and update both with ease.</p>
    
    <p>2. I need to become much more proficient with responsive web design. I've used templates to build responsive eBlasts with HTML, but I've really never built a fully functioning responsive site, and I know that's very important.</p>
 
    <p>3. I know that Javascript and jQuery will be a challenge, but I'd like to at least learn some simple animations that I could incorporate in sites on a daily basis. I make a lot of .gifs now, but .gifs aren't interactive!</p>
